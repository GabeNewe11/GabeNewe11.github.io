		<h3>Objective</h3>
		<p>
		Sanik is feeling hungover today from the weed last night. Get him some more to make him feel better. 
		</p>
		<p>
		BUT there is a catch. Since Sanik is so hungover, he thinks everything is coins, but actually they are MP3 Players that play a really good song. You have to find the right one out of the four, but be careful. They're all random. Sanic is also still drunk so he'll be hard to control.
